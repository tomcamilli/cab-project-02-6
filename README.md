* Connect buildings and meter/cost through an equation using build operational hours, # computer labs, etc.
* Add an "about" page that helps users understand how to use the application and other details (who the contributors are).
* Implement invisible buttons on the map that resize along with the map/page, have associations with certain buildings.
